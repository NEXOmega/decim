Plan:
The application is a simple command line interface that allows the user to manage his games,
storing multiple information about them.
It will also allow the user to do backups of his games and restore them.
It will also allow the user to launch his game with a single command.

TODO :
- [ ] Auto-completion of commands
- [*] Remove cli because it's useless
- [ ] Add restore for backups
- [ ] Add version history when editing a game
- [ ] Write some tests
- [ ] Improve search with levensthein distance
- [ ] Add sub args to create command
